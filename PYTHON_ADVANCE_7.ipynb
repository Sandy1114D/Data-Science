        "- `try`/`except`/`else`: This variant allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions and execute some code if no exception is raised.\n",

It is similar to the `try`/`finally` statement, but it provides a cleaner and more concise syntax. The `with/as` statement ensures that the resource is properly initialized and cleaned up, even if an exception is raised during its use."
