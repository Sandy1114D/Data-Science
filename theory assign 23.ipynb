Here, the function \"func\" takes two positional arguments a and b, and two keyword arguments b and c with default values of 6 and 8, respectively. When we call the function with arguments func(1, 2), the value 1 is assigned to argument a and 2 is assigned to argument b, the default value of c is used.\n",

When we call the function with arguments func(1, c=3, b=2), the value 1 is assigned to argument a, 3 is assigned to argument c, and 2 is assigned to argument b.\n",
        "3. The output of the code will be \"1 (2, 3)\". Here, the function \"func\" takes one positional argument a and *pargs as a tuple of positional arguments. When we call the function with arguments func(1, 2, 3), the value 1 is assigned to argument a, and (2, 3) is assigned to *pargs as a tuple.\n",

When we call the function with arguments func(a=1, c=3, b=2), the value 1 is assigned to argument a, and {'c': 3, 'b': 2} is assigned to **kargs as a dictionary.\n",

Here, the function \"func\" takes two positional arguments a and b and two keyword arguments c and d with default values of 8 and 5, respectively. When we call the function with arguments func(1, *(5, 6)), the value 1 is assigned to argument a, 5 is assigned to argument b, and 6 is assigned to argument c as *args.\n",
        "6. The output of the code will be \"1 [&#39;x&#39;] {'a': &#39;y&#39;}\". Here, the function \"func\" takes three arguments a, b, and c. In this case, we pass integer, list, and dictionary objects to the function. The variable l is an integer and is passed as is, m is a list and is passed as a reference, and n is a dictionary and is also passed as a reference. So, when we modify the values of b and c inside the function, the original objects are modified as well. Therefore, after calling the function, the value of l remains 1, the value of m is changed to ['x'], and the value of n is changed to {'a': 'y'}."
